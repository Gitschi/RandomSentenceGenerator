# RandomSentenceGenerator
Randomly generate sentences from an input string.

A random sentence generator I wrote in order to get jibberish text for testing.
It takes a long string as an input,  cuts all the words apart and pushes them into an array.
After that it will randomly generate sentences, that won't make sense, from those words.
